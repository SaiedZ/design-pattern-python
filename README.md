# Design Patterns in Python
</br>

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are time-tested, proven solutions to specific design problems that can be applied in various contexts.

Python, as a popular programming language, has many design patterns that can be applied in various applications. Understanding and applying design patterns can help to make code more maintainable, extensible, and scalable, as well as promote good software engineering practices.

## Why I Created This Repo

I created this repository as a place to learn about and practice implementing design patterns in my code.


## Why are Design Patterns Important?

Design patterns provide a number of benefits to software developers:

- **Reusability**: Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems. Developers can use these patterns in their applications to solve similar problems without having to reinvent the wheel every time.

- **Scalability** : Design patterns provide a foundation for scalable software design. By following established patterns, developers can create software that can be easily extended and modified over time.

- **Maintainability** : Design patterns promote good software engineering practices such as modularity, separation of concerns, and abstraction. These practices help to make code more maintainable and easier to understand.

- **Efficiency** : Design patterns provide efficient solutions to common problems, reducing the need for trial-and-error and allowing developers to focus on other aspects of software development.

## Common Design Patterns in Python

There are many design patterns that can be applied in Python applications. Here are some of the most common design patterns and their applications:

### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns are used to create objects in a way that is flexible and efficient. Examples of creational patterns in Python include:

- **Singleton** : Ensures that only one instance of a class is created, and provides a global point of access to that instance.
- **Factory Method** : Provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to determine which class to instantiate.
- **Builder** : Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation, allowing for flexible and efficient object creation.
- **Prototype** : Creates new objects by cloning an existing object, rather than creating a new object from scratch.

### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are used to organize objects in a way that is flexible and efficient. Examples of structural patterns in Python include:

- **Adapter**: Allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a wrapper that translates one interface to another.
- **Bridge**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.
- **Decorator**: Adds behavior to an object dynamically, without changing its class or interface.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are used to manage interactions between objects in a way that is flexible and efficient. Examples of behavioral patterns in Python include:

- **Observer** : Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy** : Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
- **Command** : Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
- **Template Method** : Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

## Conclusion

Design patterns are an important part of software engineering, providing reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems. By understanding and applying design patterns, developers can create software that is more maintainable, scalable, and efficient. In Python, there are many design patterns that can be applied in various contexts. By using these patterns, developers can create high-quality software that is easier to maintain and extend over time.
